🛡️ ProtonVPN Full Privacy Stack (Why It Matters)

I use ProtonVPN because it’s not just a VPN — it’s part of a full privacy ecosystem (Proton Mail, Drive, Calendar, and VPN) built in Switzerland, outside of 14-eyes surveillance alliances. They don’t log, they’re open-source, and they’ve been independently audited. No games.

🌐 Why I Use It on My Router Too

Running ProtonVPN *on the router* ensures **every device** in the house is protected — even ones that can’t install apps (like TVs, printers, or iPads). It creates a privacy firewall for the entire network. Kids watching YouTube? Still private. Guest devices? Covered.

🔐 Why WireGuard Instead of OpenVPN?

WireGuard is newer, lighter, and more secure by design. It’s fast, uses modern cryptography, and has a tiny codebase (less chance for bugs or backdoors). ProtonVPN gives you easy WireGuard `.conf` files you can drop into any compatible router or OS.

📁 How the Setup Works (Example)

1. Log into ProtonVPN dashboard → Downloads → WireGuard config
2. Select your country + server type (Core, Plus, Secure Core)
3. Download the `.conf` file
4. Import it into your router or use on Linux/macOS with:
   ```bash
   sudo wg-quick up my-proton-vpn

   	5.	Done. You’re tunneled through encrypted Swiss-grade infrastructure.

This isn’t just paranoia — if you’re exporting sensitive texts (iMessage, custody docs, court records), don’t leave any traces in plain sight.

Trust no app. Run your own firewall.
